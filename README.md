# 2024-CS50-Introduction-to-AI-Projects

These are my raw project submissions for the CS50AI course by HarvardX and edX
There are 12 total projects all on different forms of AI and AI algorithms

NOTE:
Please do not plagiarize my work simply for the sake of completing the course
Some of the code are also not 100% correct and it is simply what I submitted at that time
